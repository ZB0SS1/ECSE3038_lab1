The function `parallel()` when called, outputs the effective resistance of a network of 2 or more resistors connected in parallel. The function is able to accept a list of numbers of any length. this function wos written to make calculating paralelresistances easierer.

The function `potential_divider()` takes two values as argument, a number that represents a voltage supply value and a list of numbers that represent resistance values of resistors connected in series. The function then output the voltage drop across each resistor in your resistor list. The function is be able to accept a list of numbers of any length. This function was written to make the voltage drop accross different resistors in series more apparent.

The function `temperature_check()` accepts a patient's body temperature, and the unit of temperature being used. The function outputs whether the patient is hypothermic, hyperthermic or has normal a body temperature based on the number and unit of temperature passed to the function. The second value passed as argument tells the function whether the condition should calculated in degrees celcius or degrees fahrenheit. if passed in fahrenheit it is concerted to celcius then an appropriate message is written to the screen with the result. temperature limits were chosen by coders discression.this function was created to tell weather a patient is hypothermic, hyperthermic or has normal a body temperature

This code was written as a class exercise to teach students to integrate python , vs code and github
